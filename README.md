Has the demographic representation of best selling authors changed over time?

To answer this question, I'm working with data from the NYTimes Bestsellers list ([sourced from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/new-york-times-bestsellers?resource=download)). It includes books from 1931 to 2020. 

## Data cleaning decisions
For 'author', I'm taking a somewhat liberal approach and treated some editors as authors.
